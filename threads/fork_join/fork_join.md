# Fork Join
## Fork Join framework is implementation of ExecutorService interface for parallel execution.
## this framework helps to run algorithm parallel 
## Developer do not have to worry about low level synchronization and locks
## It is divide and conquer mechanism 
## Larger tasks will be divided into small tasks,after execution we combine solution
## Subtasks have to be independent inorder to be executed in parallel
## Main concept of fork-join is to break large task to small and

# Time Slicing Algorithm 
## We know that Process can contain many threads 
## Processing time for single process is shared among multiple process or threads
## when Processor handing 2 threads (Thread-1,Thread-2) processor runs thread-1 for sometime and then Thread-2 for sometime
## If we have multiple processors Thread-1 will be picked by one processor,Thread-2 picked by other processor 
## Both Thread-1,Thread-2 executed at same time

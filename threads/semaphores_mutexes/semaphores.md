# Semaphores
## Semaphores are simple variable (abstract data types) that are used for controlling access to common resource.
## It is important concept in operating system.
## 'It is a record of how many units of particular resource are available,we have to wait until resource available again'
## Counting Semaphores : allows an arbitrary resource count.
## Binary Semaphores : Semaphores that are restricted to value 0 and 1.
## Semaphores tracks only how many resource are free,it does not track which of the resource are free.
## Semaphore count may serve as useful trigger for the number of different action.
## Producer-Consumer can be solved.

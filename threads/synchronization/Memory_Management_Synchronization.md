# Memory Management

## Threads run on shared memory space and process run on separate memory space.

# Stack Memory
## Local variables , method arguments,method calls are stored in stack memory.
## Small and faster

# Heap Memory:
## Objects are stored in heap memory until its reference 
## Large and slower

# Memory management is Threads
## Each thread has it's own Stack,Cache memory
## consider there are two threads Thread-1,Thread-2, one thread local variables are not visible to other thread
# Synchronization 
## synchronization keyword make sure method is called only by one thread at a time

# Thread Priority
## Thread Scheduler decides which thread has to be executed by CPU.
## We can manually set priority for threads
## MAX_PRIORITY=10
## MIN_PRIORITY=1
## DEFAULT_PRIORITY=5
## When multiple threads has same priority they will be executed in FIFS
## Thread Scheduler stores thread in queue
